# Rust Async Load Balancer 🚦

A lightweight, educational load balancer built to explore how backend systems work in an asynchronous Rust environment.

# Overview 📌

This project is a minimal yet practical HTTP load balancer implemented in Rust using async primitives. It’s designed to help me understand:

- How backend services handle concurrent requests
- How async Rust differs from threaded or synchronous models
- How to build a real networked service using `tokio` and `hyper`
- How to forward traffic to upstream servers
- How to manage shared state safely and efficiently
